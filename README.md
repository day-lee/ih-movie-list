### Brief explanation of my apporach
- I used useReducer to manage the state, as itâ€™s great for handling more complex state updates.
- I added loading and error handling, along with messages for better user experience
- I kept the code modular by splitting it into four components: Header, Main, FilterBox, and DetailModal.  
This makes the project easier to read, maintain, and update.
